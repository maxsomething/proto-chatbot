This program depends on the node.js extension
it must be downloaded, and all it's dependencies,
before anything can work

to run the demo, get to the dir where this is installed,
and run the bat file
It's a script that checks if node and npm are installed and launches the program
you then should have something that looks like the screenshot

when you are done, ctr C in the black window to force close the local server
or turn off the machine completely if you feel unsafe
